# 🧠 Welcome to NeuroSTA 

**Neuroimaging and Speech using Transdiagnostic Approaches**

We study how brain networks and language interact across diagnostic categories — combining speech, linguistic, and neuroimaging data.

NeuroSTA stands for <ins>**Neuro**</ins>imaging and <ins>**S**</ins>peech using <ins>**T**</ins>ransdiagnostic <ins>**A**</ins>pproaches. This repository brings together work from several domains including neuroimaging, speech and language analysis, and transdiagnostic psychiatry. The goal is to support research that moves beyond traditional diagnostic boundaries by providing tools to analyze and connect brain-based and language-based data in innovative ways. In the near future, this repository will host a growing collection of well-documented scripts and resources for: Structural and functional MRI processing speech and language feature extraction multimodal data integration machine learning and clustering across diagnostic categories visualization and quality control pipelines We aim to offer open, reproducible, and modular code to support a wide range of applications in psychiatric and neuroscientific research. Stay tuned this repository will be continuously updated as new components are developed.
