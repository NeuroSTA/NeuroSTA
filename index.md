**Neuroimaging and Speech using Transdiagnostic Approaches**

We study how brain networks and language interact across diagnostic categories — combining speech, linguistic, and neuroimaging data.

---

## 🔬 Research Overview
We integrate:
- Structural and functional MRI analyses  
- Speech and linguistic feature extraction  
- Multimodal data fusion and machine learning

Our goal is to identify **transdiagnostic mechanisms** underlying communication and cognition.
