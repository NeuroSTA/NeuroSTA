Dr. Alina Nostadt was awarded a Poster Prize at the 2025 CRC/TRR 393 Retreat in Dresden for her outstanding poster:
“Transdiagnostic Identification of Cognitive Subtypes and White Matter Correlates.”

The retreat brought together early-career researchers from all CRC/TRR 393 sites and the International Research Training Group 2773, featuring nearly 70 posters across several scientific sessions. Posters were evaluated on scientific excellence, clarity of presentation, and design.

Congratulations to Alina on this well-deserved recognition!


## 🏆 April 2025 – Awards at the DISCOURSE in Psychosis Satellite Meeting (Chicago, USA) for Rieke Mülfarth and Dr. Frederike Stein 

At the DISCOURSE in Psychosis Consortium Satellite Meeting on April 3, 2025, two researchers from the NeuroSTA group were recognized for their outstanding contributions to language and psychosis research.

**Dr. Frederike Stein** (Principal Investigator) received one of seven **Early Career Researcher (ECR) Awards**, supported by the Monique H. Bourgeois Chair and the François Bourgeois Foundation in Montreal. 

**Rieke Mülfarth** (PhD candidate) was the sole recipient of the **DISCOURSE Open Science Award**. Her work was recognized for its strong potential to enhance the consortium’s open-source datasets. 

The DISCOURSE in Psychosis Consortium is dedicated to advancing our understanding of thought, language, and communication disturbances in psychotic and affective disorders. With a strong focus on the multimodal nature of language production, the consortium investigates the mechanisms underlying these disturbances and their relevance for daily life.

Congratulations to Dr. Stein and Rieke Mülfarth on these well-deserved honors!
