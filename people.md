We are happy to hear from motivated students who would like to work with us.

We regularly offer:  

- **Bachelor’s and Master’s theses** (e.g., in psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, data science)  
- **Medical doctoral projects** in psychiatry / clinical neuroscience  
- **Research internships / lab rotations** for students interested in clinical and computational neuroscience  

Possible topics include (but are not limited to):  

- Speech and language markers of affective and psychotic disorders  
- Transdiagnostic symptom dimensions and trajectories of mental illness  
- Multimodal neuroimaging (structural and functional MRI)  
- Computational psychiatry and machine learning approaches in mental health  

If you are interested in working with us, please send an email to  📧 neurosta@uni-marburg.de.

We particularly welcome applications from students who enjoy interdisciplinary work at the interface of clinical research, neuroimaging, and language/speech analysis.
