## Research Overview

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; justify-content: space-between; gap: 20px;">

<div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">

We investigate how neural circuits and language processes shape the emergence, progression, and remission of psychiatric disorders.
By combining MRI, cognition, psychopathology and naturalistic speech data, our work aims to uncover dynamic brain–behavior relationships that transcend diagnostic categories. 
<br>

Our approach integrates:
- Neuroimaging markers of structural and functional network integrity
- Computational speech analysis capturing semantic, syntactic, and acoustic features
- Predictive modeling to track illness trajectories and future symptom development
  
<br>

Our goal is to identify **transdiagnostic mechanisms** underlying communication and cognition.

## Research Areas

1. **Speech and Language Networks**  
   Using NLP and acoustic analysis to extract linguistic features from natural speech.

2. **Structural and Functional Connectivity**  
   Based on MRI data processed with tools like *CATO* and *FSL*.

3. **Transdiagnostic Mechanisms**  
   Exploring neural and linguistic markers across affective and psychotic disorders.
