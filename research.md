## 🔬 Research Overview
We integrate:
- Structural and functional MRI analyses  
- Speech and linguistic feature extraction  
- Multimodal data fusion and machine learning

Our goal is to identify **transdiagnostic mechanisms** underlying communication and cognition.

## Research Areas

We combine language, speech, and neuroimaging to study:

1. **Speech and Language Networks**  
   Using NLP and acoustic analysis to extract linguistic features from natural speech.

2. **Structural and Functional Connectivity**  
   Based on MRI and DTI data processed with tools like *CATO* and *FSL*.

3. **Transdiagnostic Mechanisms**  
   Exploring neural and linguistic markers across affective and psychotic disorders.
